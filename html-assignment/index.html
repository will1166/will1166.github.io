    <h2>About me</h2>
    <img id="my-image" src="images/gus.jpeg" alt="a headshot of Gus Franco" width="200">
    <p>Hello! My name is Carlos Augusto Willmersdorf Franco Filho, but feel free to call me <em>Gus</em>.<br>
    
    I'm Brazilian and, ever since I was born, I have lived in Brazil and dreamed of living abroad. About 3 years ago, I became dissatisfied with my career path as a Copywriter and decided to explore a transition to the UX Design field.</p>

    <blockquote>"Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower." - <cite>Steve Jobs</cite></blockquote>

    <p>That’s how I found the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at <mark>Algonquin College.</mark> While looking at different programs, I saw this one as an opportunity to explore the creative part of tech and live in a different country for a while. The IMD program is the 3<sup>rd</sup> program I’ve enrolled in, but this one feels different because it’s very hands-on from day one, and that makes me excited!</p>
