    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Carlos Augusto Willmersdorf Franco Filho, but feel free to call me <em>Gus</em>. <br><br>I'm Brazilian and, ever since I was born, I have lived in Brazil and dreamed of living abroad. About 3 years ago, I became dissatisfied with my career path as a Copywriter and decided to explore a transition to the UX Design field.</br></br></p>

    <p>That’s how I found the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at <mark>Algonquin College</mark>. While looking at different programs, I saw this one as an opportunity to explore the creative part of tech and live in a different country for a while. The IMD program is the 3<sup>rd</sup> program I’ve enrolled in, but this one feels different because it’s very hands-on from day one, and that makes me excited!</p>
